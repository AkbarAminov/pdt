## Technically these aren't sources, but more final files.
Files from tutorials are stored here so you can download, see and edit code on your own. Also if you have any suggestions for code improvement, please, fork and fix, and request for pull. I will revise every requested pull possible and merge if it does actually improve the code.


### Considering contributing?
The website with GitHub API is under development. Currently, we have the website with static content and a few links linking to the content. If you want to help with GitHub API code for the website and want to be a contributor, please fork and contact me so we can work on it =)
